title: Have you ever tried implementing a language spec?
---

Recently I was reading through (@captainsafia) Safia's post, where they dive into [the JavaScript spec](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/10.0/#sec-array.prototype.filter) to discuss the implementation of the `Array.prototype.filter` function:

Reading through the algorithm, I felt the urge to implement it. I guess I'm just programmed that way :laugh:

I didn't though. I've thought many times that it would be a fun challenge to implement a language spec, and a great way to learn about language design and the choices made by the creators of my tools. But I still have never tried.

If you've tried, what was your experience like?
If you haven't tried, why does or doesn't it sound like fun? :thinking:

(I'm asking specifically about implementing an _existing_ language spec; creating your own sounds fun, too, but not the topic I'm introducing for discussion in this post :smile: another time, perhaps!)
