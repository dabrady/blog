title: 'Have you ever tried implementing a language spec?'
---

I've thought many times that it would be a fun challenge, and a great way to learn about language design and the choices made by the creators of my tools. But I still have never tried.

If you've tried, what was your experience like?
If you haven't tried, why does or doesn't it sound like fun? :thinking:

(I'm asking specifically about implementing an _existing_ language spec; creating your own sounds fun, too, but not the topic I'm introducing for discussion in this post :smile: another time, perhaps!)
