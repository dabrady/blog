# Why?

Why's are very important to me. I don't like doing things with my time without a reason, even if that reason is as vague as "huh, sounds like fun." Why's help me figure out if I care enough to continue, by situating my actions into some wider context. Most of the time, when I find my interest in something waning, it's because I've either lost site of my why or because my why is no longer good enough to keep me coming back.

In the case of `syndicate`, my why started from one of those complex moments of understanding that often follow deep dives into rabbit holes, where a lot of things you've been processing in the background of your mind come suddenly to the front.

On this particular occasion, I was researching the subject of blogging. I had only recently written [my first blog post](), and so I had a lot to learn. I read about many things: [the origins of blogging](http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html) in the "weblogs" of the late 1990s; [various techniques](https://dev.to/amrutaranade/how-to-write-a-blog-post-the-four-drafts-method-1k7b) I could use to help me during the writing process; the communities fostered by different blogging platforms. It was this last one that eventually lead me to [the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and the concept of _POSSE_.

> **_POSSE_** is an abbreviation for **Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere**, a content publishing model that starts with posting content on your own domain first, then syndicating out copies to 3rd party services with permashortlinks back to the original on your site.

This make a lot of intuitive sense to me, since it is basically the same process used in the creation of more traditional forms of media like books and magazines: the author distributes copies of their work to the publishing companies they want to work with. The biggest difference is that I don't think authors keep taking their work to publishers after they've found one that has agreed to publish their content.

But more importantly, it reminded me that using a text editor which does not give me a copy of my content means I do not control it.
