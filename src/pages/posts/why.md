Why do gardeners gard their gardens? What do we use to plant our plants? :thinking:
<!-- / -->
I don't like doing things without intent. Without care. Without knowing why. It is in my pattern to think before I care before I write before I act.

And so it is important to me, as I begin this project, to understand the whys and wherefores that will guide its development. By sharing them with you, I hope to clarify what they are for myself.

## What am I solving? What am I learning?
So: what is this, and why am I doing it?

This, my dear reader, is a website. A very unfinished website. A website on which are rendered words I've written and art I've made. But a website is merely what you see at first glance.

In this case, much of the value emerges from the problems I'm solving. Most of them are personal, some are professional, but all are mine. My goals here are quite self-centered, though not entirely.

### Restoring my garden
Offline, the spaces I occupy are quite transient, changing every few months and years. It's hard to balance my wanderlust with my desire to have complete creative control over part of my environment. In fact, I haven't been able to do it since childhood, when my parents let me own my bedroom rather than just occupy it.

It was both a public and private space: as a visitor, you saw what I decided to show you, but some of it was intentionally hard to find. There were days when I would never leave it, and days when you might find it abandoned. It was always unfinished, and at times it was messy. It was a work of art, of heart, and me.

It was my garden: shaping it shaped myself.

I want back my garden. But how to keep it with me?

#### MAYBE PUT THIS IN THE "WHAT TOOLS?" SECTION?

Uhhhh....internet?

In my world, the internet is omnipresent. Interspace is cheap and portable and accessible. It sounds like a great place to start a public garden.

As a denizen of the internet, everyone starts out wearing a mask, and there is total freedom if you never wear the same mask twice. But if I want others to know whose garden they are visiting, then at times I must be willing to wear the same mask, willing to provide a consistent persona in a globally accessible space.

And for a person working professionally in art and tech, such a persona is a valuable asset if it is an accurate representation of yourself to some extent, and not a complete fabrication: it provides coherence in your public works and words, giving others a chance to form an opinion of you without ever meeting you. A bit scary, frankly, but only because of the limited control you have over the opinions that are formed.

In my mind, a garden is a perfect way to encourage others to explore what I care about, what I can do, and how I do it.

### Finding a written voice
I have a voice: it's high-pitched, nasally, and probably annoying. It rambles instead of pausing, and does not always speak with the care it should.

When I write, I take more time and more care than when I speak. But I am not necessarily communicating any more effectively because of it, and there are few things I loathe more in this world than being misunderstood or misrepresenting myself.

Given that software developers are professional writers, being able to write so that you are understood by humans (and not just machines) is particularly imperative.

At the moment, I have less opportunity to practice non-technical writing for humans than I would like.

## What tools will I use?
DISCLAIMER Here be technicals: things are gonna get nerdy.
## Why do I care?

---- MY COMMENT FROM DEV.TO (slightly adjusted): https://dev.to/dabrady/comment/j3oi
I don't have much experience with web development or web technologies, and decided to build a personal website to help me get familiar with some.

There were a few things I considered when choosing how to pursue this, and thus how to limit decisions.

## Off-the-shelf, or hand-rolled?
Since the main goal of this garden is to help me in my technical growth, I wanted to roll my own site instead of using a site building service like [WIX](https://wix.com) or [Squarespace](https://squarespace.com).

But I've been developing software professionally for 5 years now (and unprofessionally for a few more than that) and I've grown to appreciate the idea of "don't reinvent the wheel unless you need to" and of "separating your concerns", so I wanted my tech stack to include cutting-edge web development technologies and allow me to separate my content from my structure from my design from my behavior.

In short, I wanted to develop my site like I would any other bit of software, and so I went looking for a nice blend of power, speed, size, and flexibility.

I quickly decided that using a static site generator was something I wanted: it offered the ability to develop my site like an application, but serve it without all the baggage. I narrowed my decision down to four:

- Jekyll
- Hakyll
- Gatsby
- Hugo

In the end, all seemed great for my use case; I chose Gatsby because it didn't require knowledge of anything beyond JavaScript, HTML, and CSS: the fundamental languages of the web.

Learning to speak those was my overall goal, and I was worried that if I chose Jekyll or Hakyll I'd get lost in the weeds of learning Ruby and Haskell (feats I'm trying to consider "out of scope" for this project).

In the end, I eliminated Hugo because as a product, it felt like it was trying to be too much. I value essentialism: Gatsby had a kernel and allowed extension via plugins, like my favorite text editors; while Hugo seemed to have a lot of useful features that I would never use baked in, which meant sooner or later I'd trip over them.

I haven't made much progress on my site itself, but I've learned a ton about how a website can work already. Gatsby has been a joy to work with so far.
