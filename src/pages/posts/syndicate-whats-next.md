_I made this for people who write words they share with others:_

{% github dabrady/syndicate no-readme %}

_It distributes copies of the content you create to various publishing sites automatically._

_It took me a week of focused evenings and a weekend of dedicated hacking to polish it to my liking; and another week to write about it. This is what comes next._

what's next? plans and ideas for improvement
- I would like to add a few more adaptors to popular publishing silos, like Medium and Ghost; but I don't currently publish to those platforms so I'll need to create accounts and figure out how to use their APIs (if they even exist)
- `@rhymiz` recommended I look into integrating `pipenv` into my development workflow; not sure exactly what it is
- he also suggested I create a `readthedocs` page for the project which, given how I basically dismissed a library out-of-hand during the development of ths project because of its seemingly terrible documentation, I am definitely on board with
- I hope that someone will like this enough to improve it, and submit a pull request some day; to encourage that, I want to draft up some basic contributor notes
