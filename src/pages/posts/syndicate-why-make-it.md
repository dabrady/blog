I made this for people who write words they share with others:

{% github dabrady/syndicate no-readme %}

It distributes copies of the content you create to various publishing sites automatically.

It took me a week of focused evenings and a weekend of dedicated hacking to polish it to my liking; and another week to write about it. This is why.

# Why?

Why's are very important to me. I don't like doing things with my time without a reason, even if that reason is as vague as "huh, sounds like fun." Why's help me figure out if I care enough to continue, by situating my actions into some wider context. Most of the time, when I find my interest in something waning, it's because I've either lost site of my why or because my why is no longer good enough to keep me coming back.

In the case of `syndicate`, my why started from one of those complex moments of understanding that often follow deep dives into rabbit holes, where a lot of things you've been processing in the background of your mind come suddenly to the front.

On this particular occasion, I was researching the subject of blogging. I had only recently written [my first blog post](), and so I had a lot to learn. I read about many things: [the origins of blogging](http://www.rebeccablood.net/essays/weblog_history.html) in the "weblogs" of the late 1990s; [various techniques](https://dev.to/amrutaranade/how-to-write-a-blog-post-the-four-drafts-method-1k7b) I could use to help me during the writing process; the communities fostered by different blogging platforms. It was this last one that eventually lead me to [the IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) and the concept of _POSSE_.

> **_POSSE_** is an abbreviation for **Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere**, a content publishing model that starts with posting content on your own domain first, then syndicating out copies to 3rd party services with permashortlinks back to the original on your site.

This make a lot of intuitive sense to me, since it is basically the same process used in the creation of more traditional forms of media like books and magazines: the author distributes copies of their work to the publishing companies they want to work with. The biggest difference is that I don't think authors keep taking their work to publishers after they've found one that has agreed to publish their content.

But more importantly, it reminded me that using a text editor which does not give me a copy of my content means I do not control it.

why did I do it? motivation and goals
- discovered POSSE, reminded me of software deployment strategies, sounded fun to implement
- seemed like a good small project: clear objective and definition of success, presented a challenge matching my perceived skill level with what I imagined it would entail
- my initial enthusiasm and interest signaled to me this was something I cared about and thus worth my time
- automation my jobs away is a passion of mine
- premature automation is kind of my thing, when I'm the only stakeholder
- given my previous non-experience with blogging, starting off with POSSE and an automated syndication process seemed easier than a retroactive adoption
- I like making magic
- seemed like something other people besides me might find useful
- I'm the most productive when I have something to avoid doing and in this case, I was avoiding writing a blog post which is ironic
