I want to grow, not merely produce. This site will be home to my first garden.
<!-- / -->
To grow well, I, like my garden, need to struggle in rich soil. A tall order, these days, with so many people offering services and powertools and guides that optimize for complacency, comfort, and speed.

I've been developing professionally in web and mobile technology for the last 3 years, but I've never designed and built a website on my own. I don't know how to do this. I can tell you something is ugly, but I can't tell you much about how to make it pretty. I solve complex engineering problems at massive scale every day, but writing this first blog post has been more challenging by far. This excites me.

[One article](https://www.afternerd.com/blog/start-programming-blog) summarizes quite well most of the resources I've found on "making a website" and "starting a blog":

>If you want to build your blog from scratch using HTML, CSS, and javascript, it would take you forever.
>
>Why reinvent the wheel?
>
>Use WordPress instead.

This seems like good advice if your primary goal is the actual publishing of content: it will get you there fast and easily. I've grown to appreciate the ideas of "don't reinvent the wheel unless you have to" and "separate your concerns."

But in this case, there are certain things I do want to reinvent, because my ultimate goal is growth, not production. The tools I've chosen for tending this garden were picked based on what and how I hope to grow, and how I like to work. I'll follow-up with a more detailed discussion of my choices. I know how to wield most of the tools used in the construction of these words (with various degrees of proficiency) but I've never used them in project of my own devising and purpose.

I write a lot, but code is the only style I know I can write well. I keep diaries and journals, but those aren't written to be read, even if someday the are. A blog is a vastly different style of written communication, and one I hope to learn a great deal from.

I don't know what my voice sounds like. I don't know how I want you to see me yet: it feels strange to think that you will see me at all. I've made choices in this post that I may not make in the next, and the bones of my garden are not yet fully functional. This is new territory with familiar features, and I'm excited to explore it.
